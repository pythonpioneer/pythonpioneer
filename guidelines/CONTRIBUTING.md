## Code Style and Guidelines
To maintain code consistency, please follow our Code Style Guidelines when making changes to the project.

### Branching style
Format to create a branch:

```
issue-type/issue-description
```

Branching Style is provided for all types of issues:

- **`fix/issue-desc:`** Used for branches that address bug fixes or issues.
- **`feature/issue-desc:`** Used for branches that implement new features or enhancements.
- **`refactor/issue-desc:`** Used for branches that involve code refactoring or optimization.
- **`ui/issue-desc:`** Used for branches that focus on user interface changes or improvements.
- **`test/issue-desc:`** Used for branches related to testing or test suite improvements.
- **`docs/issue-desc:`** Used for branches that update documentation.
- **`chore/issue-desc:`** Used for branches that handle maintenance tasks or miscellaneous changes.
- **`experiment/issue-desc:`** Used for experimental or exploratory branches or to implement new algorithms.
- **`hotfix/issue-desc`:** Used for branches that address critical or urgent bug fixes.

I like to add some examples of branches:
```
ui/12-home-page
docs/65-update-docs
fix/23-submit-not-working
feature/46-copy-to-clipboard
```

Coding Style and Guidelines:

- **`Coding Style Guide:`** Follow all best practices and conventions for the Framework or the languages.
- **`Indentation and Formatting:`** Use `'4' spaces` for the indentation and follow all the best practices suited for the language and the framework.
- **`Naming Conventions:`**  Follow the suited conventions for the framework or the language, like Python follows snake_case and JavaScript follows camelCase and for classes we use PascalCase.
- **`Comments and Documentation:`** We know the importance of comments, and write comments to describe the code and why the code is written, especially for the complex or non-intuitive code sections. It is necessary to document the classes and functions.
- **`File Organization:`** Contributing to PythonpPioneer, the file structure is already there you just need to follow the file structure to help to maintain the code quality.
- **`Code Quality and Best Practices:`** Share best practices for writing high-quality code. Cover topics like error handling, code reusability, avoiding code duplication, and optimizing performance. Encourage contributors to adhere to coding standards and conventions that improve code maintainability.
